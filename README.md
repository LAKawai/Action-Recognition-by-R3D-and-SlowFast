# Action-Recognition-by-R3D-and-SlowFast
This is the demo of temporal action recognition which we use R3D and SlowFast model. 

The dataset we use is the UCF-101, you can get from this link: [BaiDuYun Link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1JtkrEud94yXcVgIQF6Mf5w?pwd=3ocn).

In the train.py, you can select to use R3D or SlowFast model. R3D may need more time to run but show a bit better performance. It is just up to you!

You should save the states of dicts of your models which have finished training into the checkpoint dir, and then, you can use them to have a test. Or you may use our pretrained model, the link of R3D is [BaiDuYun Link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1WGlMJckEMP6T__ucIOwOGQ?pwd=r9uy), and the link of SlowFast is [BaiDuYun Link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1AVDOV3437hLEnxmwT_OVKw?pwd=twee).
