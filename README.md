# Action-Recognition-by-R3D-and-SlowFast
This is the demo of temporal action recognition which we use R3D and SlowFast model. 

The dataset we use is the UCF-101, you can extract from the UCF-101.zip file.

In the train.py, you can select to use R3D or SlowFast model. R3D may need more time to run but show a bit better performance. It is just up to you!
